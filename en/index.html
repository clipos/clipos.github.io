  <div class="post-content">
    <p>The CLIP OS project is an open-source project designed by the <a href="https://ssi.gouv.fr/en">National
Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI)</a> that aims to
build a hardened, multi-level operating system, based on the Linux kernel and a
lot of free and open source software. <strong>The project is now archived, developments and maintenance are no longer assured.
It is still possible to consult the project archives on the following github directory :
<a href="https://github.com/clipos/">https://github.com/clipos/</a></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>

<p>Initially developed to answer the security requirements of French
administrations, the previous versions of CLIP OS were not publicly available.</p>

<p>Since September 2018, the project sources are published and the project is open
to contributions. Here is the list of the elements published:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The source code and documentation (in French) of CLIP OS version 4. This
source archive is made available as a reference for upstream patches
contribution and future developments. For more information, see the
<a href="/en/clipos4">page for the version 4</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The source code and documentation (in English) of CLIP OS version 5. This
is the current and actively developed version of the project which is
considered to be in beta status. For more information, see the <a href="/en/clipos5">page for
the version 5</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="clip-os-version-4">CLIP OS version 4</h3>

<p>We are publishing the version 4 of the project as a non-working reference
source archive. This version is the result of more than ten years of internal
development at ANSSI and includes the implementation of various security
features to harden a Linux based operating system.</p>

<p>Along with the source code archive, we have declassified the project
documentation (in French) with the description of security features implemented
in CLIP OS version 4.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="/en/clipos4">page for the version 4</a>.</p>

<h3 id="clip-os-version-5">CLIP OS version 5</h3>

<p>The version 5 is the currently developed version of the CLIP OS project. This
version is still in the beta stage, but already includes interesting security
properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>system-wide enforced filesystem integrity protections;</li>
  <li>system-wide enforced distinction between applications binaries and system
data;</li>
  <li>UEFI Secure Boot support.</li>
</ul>

<p>The development is now realized publicly and the project is open to
discussions, contributions and suggestions from the community.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a href="/en/clipos5">page for the version 5</a>.</p>

<h3 id="contributing">Contributing</h3>

<p>Please refer the instructions on the <a href="/en/clipos5">page for the version 5</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-anssi-opening-up-the-source-code-of-clip-os">Why is ANSSI opening up the source code of CLIP OS?</h3>

<p>The public release of the CLIP OS project is part of the <a href="https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/opengov-openparliament-les-plans-daction-du-gouvernement-et-de-lassemblee-nationale-pour-une-action-publique-transparente-et-collaborative-ont-ete-lances">“plan for a
transparent and collaborative public action” (in
French)</a>,
driven by the French DINSIC.</p>

<p>Opening up the CLIP OS project source code is also a way for ANSSI to share its
work and to enable everybody to benefit from it and reuse it to build hardened
Linux systems based on CLIP OS.</p>

<h3 id="will-the-clip-os-project-be-maintained-by-anssi">Will the CLIP OS project be maintained by ANSSI?</h3>

<p><strong>No</strong>. The project is now archived, developments and maintenance are no longer assured.
It is still possible to consult the project archives on the following github directory :
<a href="https://github.com/clipos/">https://github.com/clipos/</a>.</p>

<h3 id="is-this-a-government-made-operating-system">Is this a “government made” operating system?</h3>

<p>No. The CLIP OS project is lead and maintained by developers from
<a href="https://ssi.gouv.fr/en">ANSSI</a> but most of the source code resulting in the
final CLIP OS system image comes from popular open source projects (the Linux
kernel, the GNU Compiler Collection, etc.).</p>

<p>The project is based on <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened_Gentoo">Gentoo
Hardened</a> and has many
similarities with <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">Chromium OS</a> or the
<a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/">Yocto project</a>.</p>

<h3 id="licenses-used-for-the-published-source-code">Licenses used for the published source code</h3>

<p>This project is based on a lot of publicly developed open source software. The
parts of the code that are specific to the project are available under an open
source license (mainly <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html">LGPL
2.1+</a>).</p>

<h3 id="expected-security-features-and-major-differences-from-other-operating-systems">Expected security features and major differences from other operating systems</h3>

<p>The CLIP OS project is based on more than ten years of internal development at
<a href="https://ssi.gouv.fr/en">ANSSI</a> to build a hardened operating system.</p>

<p>Here is a list of security properties that are not easy to obtain in currently
available operating systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Multi-level support to handle information at multiple confidentiality
levels.</li>
  <li>Restricted administrator access in production: an administrator should not
be able to compromise a system deployed in production nor access user data.</li>
  <li>Fully automated and unattended builds from source of the system images.</li>
  <li>Deep environment integration opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<p>The complete list of available features is included in the documentation for
each version (see links on the page for the <a href="/en/clipos4">version 4</a> and
<a href="/en/clipos5">version 5</a>).</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-differences-with-qubes-os">What are the differences with Qubes OS?</h3>

<p>Even though the CLIP OS and Qubes OS projects have a lot of similar objectives,
they differ in practice on several topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The main mechanism for environment isolation is different:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>CLIP OS leverages Linux kernel primitives to create containers with the
help of additional features brought by Vserver, Linux kernel hardening
(grsecurity for version 4) and a tailored Linux Security Module (LSM).
This approach enables a fine-grained control on the data exchanges between
isolated environments (e.g., handling a notion of files, processes and
sockets) and permissions (e.g., restriction to ring 3 features for
malicious code, limitation on the allowed system calls).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Qubes OS leverages hardware based virtualization with a hypervisor (Xen),
and a main virtual machine (dom0) which is a GNU/Linux system with
services handling data exchange between virtual machines.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Administrators have different roles and powers:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Administrators on a CLIP OS system are not able to compromise system
integrity or access user data. They can only access a restricted set of
configuration options.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>On Qubes OS systems, the main user of each virtual machine is also the
administrator of its own environment. The system administrator of the
main domain (dom0) can change all the configuration options and may
access all user data without any restriction.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="where-are-the-download-links-can-i-install-it-on-my-personal-computer-at-home">Where are the download links? Can I install it on my personal computer at home?</h3>

<p>Just like the <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo project</a>, CLIP OS is mostly
available as source code that you need to process to create a system image. For
now, there are no pre-packaged version of CLIP OS 5 made available. The
<a href="https://docs.clip-os.org">documentation</a> contains all the instructions to
enable you to build your own version of CLIP OS 5.</p>

<h3 id="is-this-project-related-to-clip-certifiable-linux-integration-platform">Is this project related to <a href="https://quarksecurity.com/opensource.shtml">CLIP (Certifiable Linux Integration Platform)</a>?</h3>

<p>No. This is a different project with no relation with the CLIP OS project. The
name similarity is a coincidence.</p>

<p>There are a lot of reference to the shorter name “CLIP” in the source code of
the CLIP OS version 4 as it was the historic name of the project.</p>

<p>The current official and only name of the project is “CLIP OS”.</p>

<h3 id="about-anssi">About ANSSI</h3>
